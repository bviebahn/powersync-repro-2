# Welcome to your new ignited app!

> The latest and greatest boilerplate for Infinite Red opinions

This is the boilerplate that [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) uses as a way to test bleeding-edge changes to our React Native stack.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

To make things work on your local simulator, or on your phone, you need first to [run `eas build`](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/expo/EAS.md). We have many shortcuts on `package.json` to make it easier:

```bash
yarn build:ios:sim # build for ios simulator
yarn build:ios:dev # build for ios device
yarn build:ios:prod # build for ios device
```

## Env files

Expo uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to manage environment variables. You can control which .env file gets used by setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If you set `NODE_ENV` to `development`, the `.env.development` file will be used, etc.
At the moment we have the following files:
- .env.development (default) - for running against development environment
- .env.localdev - for running against local development environment

There are some package.json scripts like `start:local`, that can be used to set `NODE_ENV`, and run the app with the correct environment variables.

### `./assets` directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```tree
assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/app/components/Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('../assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```

### Running on Android
To be able to access localhost from the Android emulator, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 # this is where powersync runs
adb reverse tcp:3030 tcp:3030 # this is where the API runs
```
